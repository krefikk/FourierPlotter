# Fourier Plotter
A program that plots sinusoidal signals with the properties and trigonometric Fourier coefficients you enter and also combines them into a single signal.
It has two modes:<br>
**- Sinusoidal Plotter**<br>
**- Fourier Plotter**

In **Sinusoidal Plotter**, with the parameters you given (amplitude, frequency, phase angle), it plots 3 sine and cosine signals. <br>In **Fourier Plotter**, with the parameters you given (a0, period, trigonometric Fourier coefficients (an/bn)), it plots each trigonometric coefficient's signal.<br>Also they plot a aggregated signal to show the main signal with given parameters.
